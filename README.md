# RF-Energy-Harvesting

Works done on RF Energy Harvesting under the supervision of Professor Sudipta Chattopadhyay and guidance of Chandrima Thakur.

Worked on various relaying protocols like TSR, PSR. Current works involve designing a modified state-of-the-art Solar-RF Harvesting System; application of relaying protocols and Solar-RF Energy harvesting on UAVs , sensors etc and using SBSP ( Space-Based Solar Power ) for RF Energy Harvesting

If anyone wants to further these studies in form of a paper feel free to do so. Reach out to me @ mayukhmalidas322@gmail.com
